User Stories
The Libray of Babel is a text-based game. Users explore a hexagonal grid. Each hexagon is a room in the Library of Babel. When users click a hexagon, a text window pops up describing the room. Users can then decide to read the books in the room.

The goal of the game will be to find a book that's not gibberish. Users gain points by finding legible sentences, paragraphs, and chapters. If they find an entire book that's not gibberish, they win the game. If they don't find a legible book, the game ends when they reach 100 years of age.

When users find a sentence, paragraph, or chapter, they have the opportunity to judge its beauty. The parameters for beautiful language change over the years of the user's life. If the user decides a particular sentence is beautiful when current literary tastes would judge it ugly, the user loses points.

At the end of a user's life, the number of legible sentences, paragraphs, and chapters they have found are added up. The number of correctly identified beautiful texts are also added up. Then users are awarded a place based on their performance. They can die in obscurity, ignominy, mediocrity, glory, and validation. Validation only occurs when users have found a legible book.

Users will have the opportunity to change the floor they are on by clicking a button. This button will refresh the hexagonal grid.
